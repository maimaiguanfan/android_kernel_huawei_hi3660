config PWRSEQ_EMMC
	tristate "HW reset support for eMMC"
	default y
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects Hardware reset support aka pwrseq-emmc for eMMC
	  devices. By default this option is set to y.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called pwrseq_emmc.

config PWRSEQ_SIMPLE
	tristate "Simple HW reset support for MMC"
	default y
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects simple hardware reset support aka pwrseq-simple for MMC
	  devices. By default this option is set to y.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called pwrseq_simple.

config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.
config MMC_PASSWORDS
        boolean "MMC card lock/unlock passwords (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        select KEYS
        default y
        help
          Say Y here to enable the use of passwords to lock and unlock
          MMC cards.  This uses the access key retention support, using
          request_key to look up the key associated with each card.
          For example, if you have an MMC card that was locked using
          Symbian OS on your cell phone, you won't be able to read it
          on Linux without this support.
